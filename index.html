Brief Description of Goal of Code:
This code utlizes JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to create a web-based diagnostic tool. 
When a user accesses the link for this app, they will be presented with 6 "yes" and "no" questions asking about their symptoms. 
The responses of the users will be recorded and at the end a percentage of cold or allergy will be calculated. 
This code is not meant to diagnose any condition and should not be used to do that. 
	
Known Issues:
The length of the questionnaire too short, and the questions themselves are not descriptive enough. 
A percentage is given as a resuls but no addition information is provided which can make the results confusing.
